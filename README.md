## Project Description/Outline
* Using census and weather, how are different ride share services impacted. 

## Research Questions to Answer
* What areas of the map are most affected by weather changes?
* Ride cancellations by month?
* What is $/mi across all ride share services?

## Datasets to Be Used
#### Ride Share Sources
* https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city
* https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices
* https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2018-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/t29m-gskq

#### Weather Data
* https://openweathermap.org/api

#### Census Data

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
#### Data Mining
* Collect data for all ride share services that we want to compare
* Collect population data
* Collect weather data

#### Visualizations
* Correlate population to ride share volume
* Bar graph to show % of population that uses ride share (compare across all services)
* Show the ride share preference of specific areas (heat map)
